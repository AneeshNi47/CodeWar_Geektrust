Greetings,

This code was made pretty simple. THe interface is a comand line.
Like the Storyline the app is intended for King Shan so begins by greating king Shan

Run the code from any python installed system the process will begin

You will have to select the kingdom you want to send a message to.
Once you have send message to all kingdoms you will recieve and output to whether the Ruler of Southeros has been slected or not

IF the ruler has not been slected due to Allies less than 3 you will be asked if you want to try again. This can be andswered with Y for yes and N not no.
